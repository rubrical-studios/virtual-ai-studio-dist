## Core Principle

**System Instructions** define WHO the assistant is
**Frameworks** define WHAT process to follow
**Skills** provide reusable capabilities
**Assistant Guidelines** ensure accuracy and quality

## Valid Framework Transitions

```
VIBE ──► STRUCTURED ──► LTS
  │          ↑↓
  └────► AGILE ────────► LTS
```

**Invalid:** Structured/Agile → Vibe, LTS → Any
