- Exploratory, rapid iteration
- Commands: Vibe-Start, Try-This, That-Works, Undo-That, Run-It

**Phase 2: EVOLUTION POINT**
- Ready-to-Structure → Choose Structured OR Agile

**Phase 3: STRUCTURED**
- Switch to chosen framework with TDD

### Platform Variants (7)
- Core, Desktop, Web, Mobile, Game, Embedded, Newbie

### Newbie Integration

## IDPF-LTS Framework

**Location:** `IDPF-LTS/Long-Term-Support-Framework.md`
**Version:** v2.16.0
**Type:** Production Maintenance

### Core Tenets
1. Stability First
2. Minimal Change
3. No New Features
4. Backwards Compatibility
5. Comprehensive Testing

### What Goes Into LTS
- ✅ Critical/high bugs, security patches, doc fixes
- ❌ New features, refactoring, non-security upgrades

### Five-Phase Workflow
```
Bug Triage → Impact Assessment → Fix (TDD) → Regression Prevention → Documentation & Release
```

### Severity
- P0 Critical: 24h (data loss, security, system failure)
- P1 High: Core broken, no workaround
- P2 Medium: Workaround exists
- P3/P4: Low/Trivial

### LTS is Terminal
- No transitions FROM LTS
- New development = new major version
