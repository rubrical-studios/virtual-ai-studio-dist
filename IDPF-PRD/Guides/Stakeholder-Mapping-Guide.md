- **A**ccountable: Makes final decision (only one per item)
- **C**onsulted: Provides input
- **I**nformed: Kept updated

### Template

| Decision/Deliverable | Sponsor | Product Owner | Tech Lead | Dev Team | QA |
|---------------------|---------|---------------|-----------|----------|-----|
| Requirements approval | I | A | C | C | C |
| Technical architecture | I | C | A | R | C |
| Feature prioritization | C | A | C | I | I |
| Quality standards | I | C | C | R | A |
| Release approval | A | R | C | I | C |
