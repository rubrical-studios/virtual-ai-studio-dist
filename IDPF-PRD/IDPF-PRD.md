# IDPF-PRD Framework
**Version:** v0.18.0
**Framework-Debug:** True
**Load with:** Anti-Hallucination-Rules-for-PRD-Work.md

---

## Overview
IDPF-PRD transforms ideas into implementation-ready requirements through guided AI-assisted elicitation.
**Purpose:** Generate PRD documents for IDPF-Structured or IDPF-Agile.

---

## Terminology
1. **ASSISTANT**: AI assistant (Claude)
2. **User**: Human developer/product owner
3. **PRD**: Product Requirements Document
4. **NFR**: Non-Functional Requirement
5. **Session**: Conversation for one project's requirements

---

## Workflow Phases
```
Phase 1: Discovery → Domain Analysis, Stakeholder Mapping, Vision & Goals
Phase 2: Elicitation → Functional Reqs, Non-Functional Reqs, Constraints & Risks
Phase 3: Specification → Requirement Detailing, Acceptance Criteria, Testing Approach
Phase 4: Generation → Template Selection, PRD Assembly, Framework Handoff
```

---

## Session Initialization
1. Load Anti-Hallucination Rules
2. Declare Framework Revision
3. Display Commands
4. Begin Discovery
5. Guide through phases

**Critical:** Never invent requirements - only document stakeholder statements or code evidence.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

### Domain Analysis
- Industry/vertical, regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2)
- Similar products, domain terminology, common patterns

### Stakeholder Mapping
- Primary/secondary users, sponsors, technical authority, approval chain

### Vision & Goals
- Problem solved, vision statement, success metrics, 6-month/1-year goals

**Output:** Discovery Worksheet

---

## Phase 2: Elicitation

### Functional Requirements
- Core features, user tasks, workflows, inputs/outputs, integrations

### NFR Questions
| Category | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| Performance | Response time, concurrent users, throughput |
| Security | Authentication, authorization, encryption |
| Reliability | Availability (99.9%+), downtime, backup/recovery |
| Usability | Accessibility (WCAG), browsers/devices, locales |

### Constraints
- Budget, deadline, technology, team skills, infrastructure, legacy systems

**Output:** Elicitation Worksheet

---

## Phase 3: Specification

### Requirement Format
```
REQ-XXX: [Title]
├── Description
├── Rationale
├── Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
├── Dependencies
├── Acceptance Criteria (AC-1, AC-2, AC-3)
├── NFR Links
└── Testing Approach
```

### Testing Approach Selection
| Approach | Required | When |
|----------|----------|------|
| TDD | Yes | All development |
| ATDD | Optional | Formal acceptance, compliance |
| BDD | Optional | Stakeholder collaboration |

**Output:** Specification Worksheet

---

## Phase 4: Generation

### Template Selection
**Framework declared:**
| Framework | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| IDPF-Structured | PRD-Structured-Moderate |
| IDPF-Agile | PRD-Agile-Lightweight |

**No framework:** Use decision tree (fixed→Comprehensive, lean→Moderate, iterative→Agile)

### Framework Handoff
**To Structured:** REQ-IDs, acceptance criteria, NFRs, constraints → TDD with REQ-001
**To Agile:** Features→Epics, Capabilities→Stories, Success→AC, NFRs→DoD → Backlog creation

**Output:** PRD-[ProjectName].md

## Reverse-PRD: Extraction from Code

### When to Use
- Legacy codebase without documentation
- Pre-LTS baseline documentation
- Compliance/audit requirement generation

### Workflow
```
R1: Analyze → Structure Scan, Tech Stack, Architecture
R2: Extract → Test Parsing, API Extraction, NFR Detection
R3: Refine → User Validation, Context Addition, Priority
R4: Generate → Standard IDPF-PRD Generation
```

### Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Reverse-PRD-Start | Begin extraction |
| Reverse-PRD-Analyze | Run structure analysis |
| Reverse-PRD-Extract | Generate draft worksheets |
| Reverse-PRD-Refine | Interactive refinement |

**Skill:** `extract-prd`
**Limitation:** Extracts only explicit content; requires human refinement.

---

## Framework Transitions

**PRD → IDPF-Structured:** Fixed requirements, formal process
**PRD → IDPF-Agile:** Evolving requirements, iterative development
**PRD → Skip (IDPF-Vibe):** Exploratory, unknown scope
