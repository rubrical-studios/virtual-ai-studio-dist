### Provider Change Workflow

```markdown
## Provider Change Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. **Check pending consumer contracts**
   - Query broker for unverified contracts
   - Understand consumer expectations

2. **Assess impact**
   - Will this break any consumer contracts?
   - Which consumers are affected?

3. **Communicate**
   - Notify affected consumer teams
   - Discuss migration timeline

### Making Changes

4. **Implement with backward compatibility**
   - Add new fields/endpoints first
   - Deprecate old ones (don't remove yet)

5. **Run contract verification**
   - Verify all consumer contracts pass
   - Fix any failures

6. **Publish stubs**
   - Update stub artifacts
   - Notify consumers stubs are available

### After Changes

7. **Monitor consumer adoption**
   - Track which consumers updated
   - Follow up on stragglers

8. **Remove deprecated features**
   - Only after all consumers migrated
   - Coordinate removal timing
```

## Governance

### Contract Testing Standards

```markdown
## Contract Testing Standards

### Naming Conventions

**Contracts:**
- Format: `[consumer]-[provider]-[interaction].json`
- Example: `order-dashboard-order-service-get-order.json`

**Test Files:**
- Format: `[Provider]ContractTest.java`
- Example: `OrderServiceContractTest.java`

### Required Metadata

All contracts must include:
- Consumer name
- Consumer version
- Provider name
- Interaction description

### Verification Requirements

- All contracts must be verified before provider deployment
- Failed verifications block deployment
- Pending contracts have 5-day SLA for verification

### Review Process

New contracts require:
1. Consumer team creates contract
2. Provider team reviews (within 2 business days)
3. Technical lead approval for breaking changes
4. Security review for sensitive endpoints
```

### SLA Definitions

```markdown
## Contract Testing SLAs

### Contract Publication
- Consumer publishes contract: < 1 day after code completion
- CI pipeline runs consumer tests: < 10 minutes

### Verification
- Provider acknowledges new contract: < 2 business days
- Provider verifies contract: < 5 business days
- CI pipeline runs provider tests: < 15 minutes

### Breaking Changes
- Notification period: 2 weeks minimum
- Migration support: Available during deprecation
- Removal: Only after all consumers updated

### Incident Response
- Contract failure in production: P1 (< 4 hours)
- Contract failure in staging: P2 (< 1 business day)
- Missing contract: P3 (< 5 business days)
```

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Contract Verification Failure

```markdown
## Contract Verification Failure Runbook

### Step 1: Identify the failure

```bash
# Check broker for failed verifications
pact-broker list-latest-pact-versions \
  --provider "OrderService" \
  --broker-url $PACT_BROKER_URL
```

### Step 2: Reproduce locally

```bash
# Run provider verification locally
./gradlew contractTest
```

### Step 3: Analyze the failure

Common causes:
1. **Missing endpoint**: Consumer expects endpoint that doesn't exist
2. **Schema mismatch**: Response structure differs
3. **Status code difference**: Expected 200, got 404
4. **Missing field**: Consumer expects field provider doesn't return

### Step 4: Determine responsibility

| Cause | Responsible Team |
|-------|-----------------|
| Provider changed API | Provider |
| Consumer expects non-existent feature | Consumer |
| Incorrect contract | Consumer |
| Environment issue | Platform |

### Step 5: Resolve

- Provider issue: Fix provider code
- Consumer issue: Update consumer contract
- Coordination needed: Schedule meeting

### Step 6: Verify fix

```bash
# Re-run verification
./gradlew contractTest

# Publish results
./gradlew pactPublish
```
```

## Best Practices

| Practice | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Consumer writes first | Ensures contracts reflect actual needs |
| Verify before deploy | Catch breaking changes early |
| Communicate proactively | Avoid surprises |
| Version contracts | Support parallel development |
| Automate everything | Reduce friction |
| Central broker | Single source of truth |
| Regular reviews | Keep contracts current |
| Clear ownership | Accountability for each contract |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Provider-driven contracts | Doesn't capture actual consumer needs | Consumer-driven approach |
| Manual verification | Inconsistent, slow | CI/CD integration |
| Siloed teams | Broken contracts discovered late | Regular communication |
| Too many contracts | Maintenance burden | Focus on critical interactions |
| No governance | Inconsistent practices | Standards and policies |
| Treating as replacement for integration tests | Different purposes | Use both appropriately |
