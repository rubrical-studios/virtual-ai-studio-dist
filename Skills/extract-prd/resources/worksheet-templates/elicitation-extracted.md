## 7. Refinement Checklist

**User Action Required:**

- [ ] Review each feature for accuracy
- [ ] Confirm or reject each NFR
- [ ] Add missing features not in code
- [ ] Provide business context for features
- [ ] Prioritize features (if not detected)
- [ ] Add constraints not evident in code
- [ ] Document dependencies between features

---

## 8. User Additions

### Additional Features (Not Extracted)

[User adds features that exist but weren't detected]

### Additional NFRs (Not Detected)

[User adds NFRs not evident in code patterns]

### Additional Context

[User provides business rationale, stakeholder needs, etc.]

---

**Status:** Draft - Requires User Validation

**Next Step:** Validate all items, add missing context, then proceed to Specification phase
