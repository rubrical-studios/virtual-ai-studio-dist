## [v0.17.0] - 2025-12-29

### Breaking Changes
- **Single-Specialist Model** (#588) - Users now select ONE Base Expert at install time instead of multiple specialists:
  - `domainSpecialist` (string) replaces `domainSpecialists[]` + `primarySpecialist` in framework-config.json
  - Removed `/switch-role` and `/add-role` commands (no longer needed)
  - Future: Expertise Packs can be loaded on-demand via JIT loading

### Changed
- **Domain Specialist Reorganization** (#589-#595) - Files reorganized from flat `Domain/` to structured subdirectories:
  - `Domain/Base/` - 12 Base Experts available at install time
  - `Domain/Pack/` - 10 Expertise Packs for JIT loading
  - `Domain/PRD/` - 1 specialized PRD analyst
- **Installer Single-Specialist Support** (#603-#607) - Updated installer for single-specialist model:
  - Radio-button UI (single-select) replaces checkbox UI (multi-select)
  - Schema migration: `domainSpecialists[]` + `primarySpecialist` → `domainSpecialist`
  - Orphaned command cleanup (`switch-role.md`, `add-role.md`)
- **Branch Naming Enforcement** (#586) - `/open-release` now enforces `[prefix]/[name]` format:
  - Exactly one `/` separator required
  - Both prefix and name must be non-empty
  - Examples: `release/v1.2.0`, `patch/v1.9.1`, `hotfix/auth-bypass`

### Removed
- **`/switch-role` command** - No longer needed with single-specialist model
- **`/add-role` command** - No longer needed with single-specialist model
- **Multi-select specialist prompt** - Replaced with single-select

### Documentation
- **Migration Guide** (#609-#611) - Added comprehensive migration documentation in `Releases/idpf/domain-reorg/release-notes.md`
- **Updated Domain-Selection-Guide.md** - Reflects single-specialist model
- **Superseded note added** - `Dynamic-Domain-Specialist-Roles.md` marked as superseded

---

## [0.16.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Installer config schema mismatch** (#581) - Fresh installations now use the new v0.16.0 config schema (`frameworkVersion`, `extensibleCommands`, `frameworkScripts`, `userScripts`) instead of the deprecated schema. Updates and migrations also properly migrate old `installedVersion`/`components` fields to the new schema.
- **Shebang displacement in JS files** (#584) - Fixed `version-header-fix.js` inserting version comment before shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`). Shebang must be first line for Unix script execution.

---

## [0.16.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Extensible Commands Installer** (#559) - Complete system for preserving user extensions during framework upgrades:
  - `install/lib/extensibility.js` - Extension block parsing, restoration, rogue edit detection, frontmatter merging, deprecation handling (REQ-002-006, REQ-010, NFR-003)
  - `install/lib/checksums.js` - SHA256 checksum computation for modification detection (NFR-002)
  - `install/lib/config.js` - Config management, manifest parsing, project type detection, schema migration (REQ-011, REQ-013-015)
  - Enhanced `install/lib/deployment.js` - Directory structure creation, framework script deployment with checksum tracking (REQ-007-009)
  - Enhanced `install/lib/detection.js` - Git clean state verification before upgrades (REQ-001)
  - Enhanced `install/lib/ui.js` - UpgradeError class with rollback instructions (NFR-001)
- **PRD for Extensible Commands Installer** (#559) - Comprehensive requirements document with 15 requirements and 3 NFRs
- **Templates for extensible commands** - Populated `Templates/` directory with framework scripts, shared utilities, and hooks

### Changed
- **Proposal consolidation** - Split extensibility proposal into Framework and Installer documents for clearer separation of concerns
- **Archive management** - Added archive notices to superseded proposals (Base-Template, original Extensible-User-Commands)

### Fixed
- **Script paths in command templates** (#579) - Updated 7 command templates to use correct `.claude/scripts/shared/` paths after extensibility reorganization

---

## [0.15.4] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Release artifact orphaning** (#549) - Moved release artifact generation (release-notes.md, changelog.md) from `/close-release` to `/prepare-release` Phase 2l. Artifacts are now committed with the release PR instead of being orphaned when the release branch is deleted
- **Temp file gitignore pattern** (#550) - Added `.tmp-*` pattern to `.gitignore`. The existing `*.tmp` pattern only matched files ending in `.tmp`, not workflow temp files starting with `.tmp-`

---

## [0.15.3] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Windows Shell Safety rules** (#524) - Consolidated Windows-specific shell guidance into platform-conditional rule file (`05-windows-shell.md`), deployed only on Windows systems

### Changed
- **`/open-release` track prefix handling** (#547) - Now requires explicit track prefix (e.g., `release/v1.0`, `patch/v1.0.1`) instead of assuming `release/`. Supports any custom track prefix via pass-through validation
- **`/add-role` token optimization** (#548) - Reduced command file from ~140 to ~60 lines (57% reduction) by using directory discovery instead of embedded specialist lists. Now supports direct argument (e.g., `/add-role Security-Engineer`)
- **Installer branch check** (#546) - Installation now checks if target project is on `main`/`master` branch. Cancels with warning on feature branches unless `--force` flag is used

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Windows guidance removed** - Eliminated redundancy between CLAUDE.md and GitHub-Workflow.md Shell Limitations sections

---

## [0.15.2] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Inconsistent Patches/ and Releases/patch/ directory structure** (#536) - Consolidated all release artifacts under unified `Releases/{track}/` structure matching branch naming convention (`release/`, `patch/`, `hotfix/`)

### Changed
- **`/close-release` updated for track-based paths** (#536) - Now writes artifacts to `Releases/{track}/vX.Y.Z/` based on branch prefix
- **GitHub Workflow updated to v1.7** - Updated artifact paths to use `Releases/{track}/` pattern

---

## [0.15.1] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Distribution deployment missing npm dependencies** (#526) - Added `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to `deploy-dist.yml` to fix `Cannot find module 'prompts'` error when users run `node install.js`
- **install.js wrapper not calling main()** (#531) - Fixed wrapper to explicitly call `main()` instead of relying on `require.main === module` check which fails for required modules

---

## [0.15.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- **Release lifecycle commands** (#513) - Complete release lifecycle trilogy implementing trunk-based development:
  - `/open-release` - Opens release branch and creates tracker issue
  - `/close-release` - Generates release notes, creates GitHub Release, deletes branch
  - Both dev and user versions created (`.claude/commands/` and `Templates/commands/`)
- **Trunk-based development workflow** (#513) - Tags now created on `main` after PR merge, not on release branches

### Changed
- **Installer modular architecture** - Refactored install.js into modular architecture for improved maintainability
- **Anti-hallucination rules enhanced** - Added command/URL verification to prevent hallucinated commands and URLs
- **`/prepare-release` updated for trunk-based flow** (#513) - Phase 3 now: PR to main → merge → checkout main → tag main → push tag

### Fixed
- **README-DIST.md version** - Fixed hardcoded version and updated skill count to use dynamic values
- **Shebang displacement in 10 JS files** (#500, #506) - Fixed version-header-fix.js inserting version comment before shebang
