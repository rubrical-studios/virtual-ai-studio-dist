## 2. Hypothesis

### 2.1 Steady State Definition

| Metric | Expected Value | Source | Dashboard |
|--------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Request success rate | > 99.9% | Prometheus | [Link] |
| p99 latency | < 500ms | Datadog | [Link] |
| Throughput | > 1000 req/s | Application metrics | [Link] |
| Error rate | < 0.1% | Logs | [Link] |

### 2.2 Hypothesis Statement

```
Given: [steady-state conditions - be specific with metrics]

When: [fault injection description - what exactly will happen]

Then: [expected system behavior - measurable outcomes]
```

**Example:**
```
Given: Order service is processing 1000 orders/minute with p99 < 500ms
       and error rate < 0.1%

When: Primary database replica is terminated

Then: - Service detects failure within 10 seconds
      - Automatic failover to secondary completes within 30 seconds
      - No orders are lost (0 data loss)
      - p99 remains < 2000ms during failover
      - Error rate stays below 1% during failover
      - Full recovery to normal p99 < 500ms within 2 minutes
```

### 2.3 Expected Outcomes

- [ ] System detects failure within [X] seconds
- [ ] Automatic failover/recovery occurs within [Y] seconds
- [ ] No data loss
- [ ] User impact limited to [description]
- [ ] Alerts fire correctly
- [ ] Runbooks are accurate

## 3. Experiment Design

### 3.1 Fault Injection

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Fault Type | [e.g., Instance termination, Latency injection] |
| Fault Category | [Infrastructure / Network / Application / Dependency] |
| Target | [e.g., order-service pod, database replica] |
| Scope | [e.g., 1 of 3 replicas, 10% of traffic] |
| Duration | [e.g., 5 minutes] |
| Tool | [e.g., LitmusChaos, Gremlin, AWS FIS] |

### 3.2 Fault Configuration

```yaml
# Tool-specific configuration (example for LitmusChaos)
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: [experiment-name]
spec:
  # Configuration details
```

### 3.3 Blast Radius Controls

| Control | Setting | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Target Scope | [e.g., Single pod] | [Why this scope] |
| Affected Users | [e.g., < 1%] | [How limited] |
| Duration Limit | [e.g., Max 10 minutes] | [Time boundary] |
| Auto-Rollback | [e.g., Error rate > 5%] | [Threshold] |

### 3.4 Abort Conditions

**Immediately stop experiment if ANY of these occur:**

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Error rate | > [X]% | Abort |
| Latency p99 | > [Y]ms | Abort |
| Revenue impact | Any detected | Abort |
| Customer complaints | Any received | Abort |
| On-call escalation | Triggered | Abort |
| Data integrity | Any concern | Abort |

| Latency p99 | [Link] | < 500ms | > 2000ms |
| CPU utilization | [Link] | < 60% | > 90% |
| Memory utilization | [Link] | < 70% | > 90% |
| [Custom metric] | [Link] | [Range] | [Threshold] |

### 4.2 Logs to Watch

| Log Source | Query/Filter | Looking For |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Application logs | `level:error service:[name]` | Error spikes |
| System logs | `OOM\|Killed\|terminated` | System failures |
| Database logs | `failover\|connection` | DB events |

### 4.3 Traces

- [ ] Distributed tracing enabled
- [ ] Trace sampling increased for experiment window
- [ ] Key transaction traces bookmarked

### 4.4 Baseline Capture

**Capture before experiment:**
- [ ] Screenshot of steady-state dashboards
- [ ] Note current metric values
- [ ] Record timestamp of baseline
