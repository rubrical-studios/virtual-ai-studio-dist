# IDPF-Chaos Framework
**Version:** v0.18.0
**Extends:** IDPF-Testing-Core
**Framework-Debug:** True

---

## Overview
Framework for chaos engineering experiments: resilience testing, fault injection, failure scenario validation.
**Core Principle:** Proactively test system resilience by introducing controlled failures.

---

## Chaos Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Build a Hypothesis | Define expected behavior under failure |
| Vary Real-World Events | Inject realistic failures |
| Run in Production | Test real systems safely |
| Automate Experiments | Enable continuous validation |
| Minimize Blast Radius | Start small, expand gradually |

---

## Terminology
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Chaos Experiment | Controlled fault injection with hypothesis |
| Steady State | Normal system metrics before fault |
| Blast Radius | Scope of potential impact |
| GameDay | Scheduled event with multiple scenarios |
| Abort Condition | Threshold triggering experiment stop |

---

## Fault Types

### Infrastructure
Instance termination, AZ/Region failure, Disk failure, Resource exhaustion

### Network
Latency injection, Packet loss, DNS failure, Network partition

### Application
Memory pressure, CPU stress, Process kill, Thread exhaustion

### Dependency
Service unavailable, Slow dependency, Database failure, Cache eviction

---

## Tool Selection
| Tool | Platform | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Chaos Monkey | AWS | Instance termination |
| Gremlin | Multi-cloud | Enterprise chaos |
| LitmusChaos | Kubernetes | K8s native |
| AWS FIS | AWS | AWS infrastructure |
| Toxiproxy | Any | Network simulation |

---

## Experiment Design

### Hypothesis Template
```
Given: [steady-state conditions]
When: [fault is injected]
Then: [expected behavior]
```

### Blast Radius Controls
- Target Scope: 1 of 10 pods
- Duration: Max 10 minutes
- Auto-Rollback: Error rate > 5%
- Environment: Staging first

### Abort Conditions
- Error rate > threshold
- Latency > threshold
- Revenue impact detected
- Data loss detected

---

## Experiment Workflow
```
Define Hypothesis → Set Up Observability → Design Experiment → Get Approval → Run Experiment → Analyze Results → [Expand Scope / Fix System]
```

## GameDay Planning

### Structure
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Kickoff | 15 min |
| Experiments | 2-4 hours |
| Debrief | 30 min |
| Documentation | 1 hour |

### Roles
GameDay Lead, Fault Operator, Observer, Scribe, On-Call

---

## Safety Practices

### Progressive Complexity
1. Single instance, Development (Self-approval)
2. Single instance, Staging (Team lead)
3. Multiple instances, Staging (Manager)
4. Single instance, Production (SRE lead)
5. Multiple instances, Production (VP)

## GitHub Labels
| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| experiment | Chaos experiment |
| gameday | GameDay related |
| infrastructure-fault | Infrastructure failure |
| network-fault | Network failure |
| finding | Resilience finding |

---

## Session Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Chaos-Start | Begin session |
| Design-Experiment | Create experiment plan |
| Plan-GameDay | Plan GameDay event |
| Run-Experiment | Execute experiment |
| Abort-Experiment | Emergency stop |
| Chaos-Report | Generate results |

---

## Best Practices
**Do:** Clear hypothesis, define abort conditions, notify stakeholders, staging first, document findings
**Don't:** Run without monitoring, skip hypothesis, ignore abort conditions, run in prod without approval

---

## Maturity Model
| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 Initial | Manual, staging only |
| 2 Managed | Documented, some production |
| 3 Defined | Standard processes, regular GameDays |
| 4 Measured | Automated, continuous production |
| 5 Optimized | Fully automated, proactive |
