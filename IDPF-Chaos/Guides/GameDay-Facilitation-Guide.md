## Planning Phase (2-4 Weeks Before)

### Stakeholder Alignment

```markdown
## GameDay Proposal

### Overview
- **Date/Time:** [Proposed date, business hours]
- **Duration:** [2-4 hours]
- **Environment:** [Production/Staging]
- **Scope:** [Services/systems involved]

### Objectives
1. Validate [specific resilience capability]
2. Test [team response to scenario X]
3. Measure [recovery time, detection speed]

### Scenarios (High-Level)
- Scenario 1: [Database failover]
- Scenario 2: [Service dependency failure]
- Scenario 3: [Network partition]

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Customer impact | Low | Medium | Staged rollout, immediate abort |
| Data loss | Very Low | High | Read-only experiments first |
| Extended outage | Low | High | Pre-tested rollback procedures |

### Required Approvals
- [ ] Engineering Lead
- [ ] SRE/Platform Lead
- [ ] Product Owner (if production)
- [ ] Security (if applicable)

### Success Criteria
- All scenarios executed without unplanned customer impact
- Mean time to detect < [X minutes]
- Mean time to recover < [Y minutes]
- Documented learnings and action items
```

### Scenario Design

```markdown
## Scenario: Database Primary Failover

### Hypothesis
"When the primary database becomes unavailable, the application will failover
to the replica within 30 seconds with no more than 5% error rate spike."

### Injection
- **Type:** Kill database primary instance
- **Tool:** Chaos Mesh / AWS FIS / Manual
- **Duration:** Until failover complete (max 5 minutes)
- **Blast Radius:** Database cluster only

### Expected Behavior
1. Health checks detect primary down (< 10s)
2. Connection pool reconnects to replica (< 20s)
3. Application returns to normal (< 30s total)
4. Alerts fire and notify on-call

### Abort Criteria
- Error rate > 20% for 60 seconds
- Total outage (0 successful requests) for 30 seconds
- Any sign of data corruption

### Rollback Procedure
1. Restore original primary (if possible)
2. Manually point to replica
3. Scale up application if connection issues

### Observability Checkpoints
- [ ] Database connection metrics visible
- [ ] Failover event logged
- [ ] Alert triggered
- [ ] Recovery time measurable

### Owner
[Name] - responsible for injection and monitoring
```

### Participant Preparation

```markdown
## GameDay Participant Guide

### Before the GameDay

**All Participants:**
- [ ] Review system architecture diagram
- [ ] Understand your role (observer/responder/facilitator)
- [ ] Know the abort signal
- [ ] Have access to dashboards and communication channels
- [ ] Clear your calendar for the full duration

**Responders:**
- [ ] Review runbooks for relevant scenarios
- [ ] Ensure access to production systems
- [ ] Test communication tools (Slack, Zoom, etc.)
- [ ] Know escalation paths

**Observers:**
- [ ] Prepare observation template
- [ ] Focus area assigned
- [ ] Note-taking setup ready

### During the GameDay

- Stay in the communication channel
- Follow the facilitator's lead
- Call out issues immediately
- Document everything you observe
- Respect the abort signal

### Abort Signal

If anyone says "ABORT" or "STOP":
1. All injection stops immediately
2. Begin rollback procedures
3. Wait for facilitator to assess
```

### Opening (15 minutes)

"Welcome to GameDay [Name]. Today we're testing [objective].

Ground rules:
1. Anyone can call ABORT at any time
2. Stay in the Slack channel throughout
3. Observers: document, don't intervene
4. Responders: respond as you would to a real incident
5. No blame - we're learning together

Abort criteria for all scenarios:
- Error rate > 25%
- P95 latency > 10 seconds
- Any sign of data corruption
- Customer complaints

Any questions before we begin?"

### Scenario Introduction (Per Scenario)

"Scenario [N]: [Name]

Starting... now."

### During Scenario

[Monitor dashboards]
[Note timeline of events]
[Be ready to call abort]
[Let responders respond naturally]

### Scenario Conclusion

"I'm ending the injection now.

Quick observations:
- Time to detect: [X minutes]
- Time to recover: [Y minutes]
- Max error rate: [Z%]

Let's take 5 minutes to stabilize and document observations."

[Go around]

Action items I captured:
[List major items]

Detailed retrospective scheduled for [date/time].

Thank you all for participating."

## GameDay Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Next Steps |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **1: Ad-hoc** | Occasional, unstructured testing | Establish regular schedule |
| **2: Repeatable** | Regular tabletop exercises | Move to staged injection |
| **3: Defined** | Documented scenarios, staged injection | Expand to production |
| **4: Managed** | Production GameDays, metrics-driven | Automate scenarios |
| **5: Optimizing** | Continuous chaos, automated learning | Scale across organization |

---

## Best Practices

| Practice | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Start with tabletop | Build confidence before injection |
| Limit blast radius initially | Reduce risk while learning |
| Include diverse perspectives | Different eyes catch different issues |
| Document everything | Learnings are the main value |
| Follow up on action items | Otherwise the effort is wasted |
| Celebrate findings | Problems found are problems prevented |
| Increase difficulty over time | Grow resilience progressively |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Skipping planning | Chaotic chaos | Minimum 2 weeks prep |
| No abort criteria | Can't stop safely | Define before starting |
| Hero mode | Single person fixes everything | Team response practice |
| Blame game | Discourages honesty | Blameless approach |
| No follow-up | Findings forgotten | Track action items |
| Too ambitious | Overwhelming scope | Start small, grow |
