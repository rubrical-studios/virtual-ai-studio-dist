**Resource Management:** Namespace isolation | Quotas | Cost tracking | Auto-scaling | Lifecycle management
---
## Service Catalog & Templates
**Templates:** Microservice scaffolding | API templates | DB schemas | Monitoring config | CI/CD | IaC
**Code Generators:** Yeoman, Cookiecutter, Plop | Custom scaffolding
**Catalog:** Service discoverability | Metadata (owner, SLA, deps) | API docs | Examples
---
## Developer Tooling
**CLI:** Platform CLI | Autocomplete | Help docs | Consistent structure | Plugin architecture
**IDE:** Extensions | Snippets | Linting/formatting configs | Debug configs | Cloud resource exploration
**Local Testing:** Unit frameworks | Integration helpers | Mock services | Load/API testing
---
## Observability Platform
**Metrics:** Prometheus, Grafana | Pre-built dashboards | SLI/SLO tracking | Alert templates
**Logging:** ELK, Loki, Splunk | Structured logging | Correlation | Retention | Query templates

---
## Security & Compliance
**Secrets:** Vault, AWS Secrets Manager | Rotation | Audit logs | CI/CD integration
**Access:** SSO | RBAC | Service-to-service auth | Audit logging
**Compliance:** Policy as Code (OPA, Sentinel) | Security scanning | Compliance dashboards | Evidence collection
---
## Platform vs DevOps
**DevOps:** Bridge dev/ops, focus on delivery pipelines
**Platform:** Build internal products (platforms) for developers
**Relationship:** Platform enables DevOps practices
