| CI/CD Pipelines | Standardized build/deploy |
| IaC Templates | Reusable patterns |
| Secret Management | Centralized secrets |
| Observability | Logs, metrics, traces |
| Dev Environments | Consistent local/cloud |

---

## Developer Experience
**Metrics:** SPACE Framework, DORA metrics, build times, satisfaction surveys
**Onboarding:** Automated setup, docs, tutorials, templates
**Reduce Cognitive Load:** Hide complexity, sensible defaults, automated tasks

---

## Development Environments
**Local:** Docker Compose, Minikube/Kind, Dev Containers
**Cloud:** GitHub Codespaces, GitPod, ephemeral PR environments
**Parity:** IaC consistency, feature flags

---

## CI/CD Platform
**Features:** Reusable templates, caching, parallel jobs, artifacts, security scanning
**Deployment:** Blue-green, canary, feature flags, rollback

## Tools
Backstage, Port, Humanitec, Crossplane, ArgoCD/Flux, Telepresence, Tilt

---

## Best Practices
**Always:** DevEx focus, self-service, standardization, documentation, automation, observability, security, feedback loops, metrics
**Avoid:** Building without input, over-engineering, forcing adoption, blocking with approvals, neglecting reliability
