## Critical: Focus on Feel

**Most important question:** Does it feel good to play?
- Not: Is code clean?
- But: Is movement responsive? Is jumping satisfying?

**Rate feel before next feature.**

---

## Feel Iteration Pattern

1. Implement basic mechanic
2. Run and play-test
3. Ask: "How does it feel?"
4. Adjust ONE parameter (speed/jump/gravity)
5. Test again
6. Repeat until right
7. THEN next feature

## Placeholder Assets

**Godot:** ColorRect node, 32x32, blue
**Unity:** Cube/Square, scale, change color
