## 5. Vulnerability Management

### 5.1 Severity Classification

| Severity | CVSS Score | Remediation SLA | Escalation |
|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | 24 hours | Immediate to leadership |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | 7 days | Security lead |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | 30 days | Dev team lead |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | 90 days | Backlog |

### 5.2 Vulnerability Workflow

```
Discovery → Triage → Assignment → Remediation → Verification → Closure
```

| Phase | Owner | Actions |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Discovery | Security Team | Identify finding, document details |
| Triage | Security Lead | Validate, assess severity, prioritize |
| Assignment | Security Lead | Assign to responsible developer/team |
| Remediation | Dev Team | Implement fix, create PR |
| Verification | Security Team | Re-test, confirm fix |
| Closure | Security Lead | Document resolution, close issue |

### 5.3 Exception Process

For vulnerabilities that cannot be remediated within SLA:

1. Document business justification
2. Identify compensating controls
3. Obtain approval from Security Lead AND Product Owner
4. Set review date (max 90 days)
5. Track in exceptions register

## 6. CI/CD Integration

### 6.1 Pipeline Gates

| Stage | Tool | Gate Criteria | Action on Fail |
|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| Commit | SAST | No critical/high issues | Block merge |
| Commit | Secret Scan | No secrets detected | Block merge |
| PR | SCA | No critical vulnerabilities | Block merge |
| Pre-Deploy | DAST | No critical findings | Block deploy |

### 6.2 Scan Configuration

```yaml
# Example gate configuration
gates:
  sast:
    fail_on: [critical, high]
    warn_on: [medium]
  sca:
    fail_on: [critical]
    warn_on: [high]
  dast:
    fail_on: [critical]
  secrets:
    fail_on: [any]
```

### 6.3 Baseline Management

| Tool | Baseline File | Review Frequency |
