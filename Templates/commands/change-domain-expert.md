**If argument provided:** Use the specified specialist name.

**If no argument:** Present the numbered list above and ask user to select (1-12) or type the specialist name.

### Step 3: Validate Selection

The specialist must be one of the 12 Base Experts listed above.
If invalid, report error and stop.

### Step 4: Update framework-config.json

3. The "Active Role" confirmation message

### Step 7: Load New Specialist

```bash
cat "{frameworkPath}/System-Instructions/Domain/Base/{new-specialist}.md"
```

### Step 8: Report Completion
