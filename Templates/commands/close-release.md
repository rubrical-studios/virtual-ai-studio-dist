git tag -l "$VERSION"
```

### Step 3: Verify All Issues Done

```bash
gh pmu release current --json issues
```

### Step 4: Verify Release Assets Uploaded

```bash
gh release view $VERSION --json assets | jq '.assets[].name'
```

Expected assets (from tag-triggered workflow):
- darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64
- linux-amd64, linux-arm64
- windows-amd64.exe, windows-arm64.exe
- checksums.txt

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-close -->
### Verify All Platform Binaries

Confirm all expected binaries are present:

```bash
gh release view $VERSION --json assets | jq '.assets | length'
```

**If any assets are missing, report warning before proceeding.**
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-close -->

### Step 5: Create GitHub Release Page

```bash
gh release create "$VERSION" \
  --title "Release $VERSION" \
  --generate-notes
```

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-github-release -->
### Update Release Notes

```bash
node .claude/scripts/framework/update-release-notes.js
```

Update release notes with formatted CHANGELOG content.
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-github-release -->

### Step 6: Close Tracker Issue

```bash
gh pmu release close
```

### Step 7: Delete Release Branch

```bash
git push origin --delete "release/$VERSION"
git branch -d "release/$VERSION"
```

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-cleanup -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-cleanup -->

### Step 8: Report Completion

```
Release $VERSION closed.

GitHub Release: https://github.com/[owner]/[repo]/releases/tag/$VERSION

Assets:
  - darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64
  - linux-amd64, linux-arm64
  - windows-amd64.exe, windows-arm64.exe
  - checksums.txt

Cleanup:
  - Tracker issue closed
