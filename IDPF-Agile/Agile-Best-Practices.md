# Agile-Driven Development Framework - Best Practices
**Version:** v0.18.0
**Module:** Best Practices (loaded on-demand)

---

## Story Writing
**DO:** Use "As a... I want... So that...", focus on user value, keep small (1-3 days), include acceptance criteria, estimate relatively
**DON'T:** Write technical tasks as stories, make too large, skip criteria, estimate in hours

---

## Sprint Planning
**DO:** Select cohesive stories, consider dependencies, sustainable velocity, mix features/tech debt, leave buffer
**DON'T:** Overcommit, select unrelated stories, ignore tech debt, skip estimation

---

## Development
**DO:** TDD rigorously, commit frequently with references, update status, ask for help, refactor continuously
**DON'T:** Skip tests, work multiple stories, let debt accumulate, ignore failing tests

---

## Review & Retrospective
**DO:** Celebrate, be honest, identify actions, adjust process, track velocity
**DON'T:** Skip retros, blame individuals, repeat mistakes, ignore data
