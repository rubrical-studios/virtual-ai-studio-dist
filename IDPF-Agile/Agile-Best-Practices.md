# Agile-Driven Development Framework - Best Practices
**Version:** v0.7.0
**Module:** Best Practices

---

## Story Writing
**DO:** "As a...I want...So that...", small stories (1-3 days), clear acceptance criteria, relative estimates
**DON'T:** Technical tasks as stories, large stories, skip criteria, estimate in hours

## Sprint Planning
**DO:** Cohesive sprint goal, consider dependencies, sustainable velocity, include tech debt, buffer for issues
**DON'T:** Overcommit, unrelated stories, ignore debt, skip estimation

## Development
**DO:** Follow TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), commit frequently, update status, ask when blocked
**DON'T:** Skip tests, work multiple stories, accumulate debt, ignore failures

## Review & Retro
**DO:** Celebrate, be honest, actionable improvements, track velocity
**DON'T:** Skip retros, blame individuals, repeat mistakes, ignore data

## Special Scenarios
- **Story-Blocked:** Add `blocked` label + reason
- **Story-Growing:** Add `scope-creep` label, split if needed
- **Emergency-Bug:** Create P0 issue with `emergency` label
- **Pivot:** Review each story (keep/archive/close)
