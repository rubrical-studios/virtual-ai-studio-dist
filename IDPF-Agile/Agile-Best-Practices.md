# Agile-Driven Development Framework - Best Practices
**Module:** Best Practices (loaded on-demand)

## Story Writing
**DO:** "As a... I want... So that...", focus on user value, small stories (1-3 days), clear acceptance criteria, estimate relatively
**DON'T:** Technical tasks as stories, large stories, skip criteria, estimate in hours

## Sprint Planning
**DO:** Cohesive sprint goal, consider dependencies, sustainable velocity, mix features + tech debt, leave buffer
**DON'T:** Overpack points, unrelated stories, ignore tech debt, skip estimation

## Development
**DO:** TDD rigorously, commit frequently with story refs, update status, ask for help when blocked, refactor continuously
**DON'T:** Skip tests, multiple stories simultaneously, accumulate tech debt, ignore failing tests

## Review & Retrospective
**DO:** Celebrate completed, be honest, actionable improvements, adjust process, track velocity
**DON'T:** Skip retros, blame individuals, repeat mistakes, ignore data

## Special Scenarios

**Story Blocked:** "Story-Blocked [ID] [reason]" → document, resolve/move/replace, update backlog

**Scope Creep:** "Story-Growing [ID]" → analyze, split/re-estimate/defer, learn for future

**Emergency Bug:** "Emergency-Bug [description]" → create story, add to sprint, TDD fix, document

**Scope Change:** "Pivot [direction]" → update backlog, re-prioritize, resume
